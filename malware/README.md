# Malware Detection Test Module

Tests SWG effectiveness against malware downloads and assembly.

## How It Works

1. Splits EICAR test file into three fragments
2. Attempts to download and reassemble fragments
3. Tests if SWG can detect:
   - Individual fragment downloads
   - Assembly attempts
   - Completed EICAR file

## Files

- `fragments/` - Contains EICAR test file fragments
  - `fragment_1.html` - First part of EICAR
  - `fragment_2.html` - Middle part of EICAR
  - `fragment_3.html` - Final part of EICAR
- `script.js` - Fragment assembly logic
- `index.html` - Test interface

## Test Cases

1. Direct EICAR download attempt
2. Fragment download detection
3. Client-side assembly detection
4. Content inspection capabilities
5. **Reconstruct from Image**: Fetches an image and uses its data to reconstruct the malware.

## Expected SWG Behavior

1. Block access to known malware signatures
2. Detect EICAR test file fragments
3. Block reassembly attempts
4. Generate malware alerts

## Running Tests

1. Visit https://malware.swgaudit.com
2. Click "Download" button
3. Check if downloads are blocked
4. Verify SWG alerts for malware detection
